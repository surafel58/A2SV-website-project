                                                  data structures and algorithms quite challenging. A2SV's 
                                                  smooth learning process and dedicated team molded me to see 
                                                  the peak of my abilities. Through A2SV's effective education
                                                  and continual support, I passed Google's internship interviews 
                                                  and attended a summer internship at Google in Amsterdam. However, 
                                                  the A2SV program and training is beyond technical education and
                                                  interview preparation. As an A2SVian, I also learned the values 
                                                  of putting humanity first, giving back to our community, and utilizing
                                                  teamwork with my colleagues, which I can now consider my big family. 
                                                  After completing three remarkable months at Google, I was offered a 
                                                  full-time position at Google's London office for 2022. “`
